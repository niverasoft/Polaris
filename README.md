# Versioning
Versions have a really simple pattern. 

**Example**: 1.0.0-A-TES
The first number (1) is the **Major** version number.
The second number (0) is the **Minor** version number.
The third value (0) is the **Build** version number.
The fourth letter (A) is the **Debug** version letter.
The fifth part (TES) is the branch identifier.

## Version numbers

**Major**
Major version number will be changed only if a really important update happens (like a full rewrite).

**Minor**
Minor version number will be changed only if an important update/fix happens.

**Build**
Build version number will be changed only if a fix is implemented, even a small one.

**Debug**
The debug version letter will be changed only if a testing fix/testing build gets released.

**Branch**
The branch identifier is used to recognize the release build type.

REL = Release, heavily tested build intented for everyday use.
BET = Beta, lightly tested build with new features in testing, may contain bugs.
TES = Testing, completely untested build with new features/fixes in testing, almost certainly contains bugs.
